# vim

Just my vim configuration. On github for automation reasons.

### Installation

Make sure you save your old vimrc and its directory somewhere else before doing
this.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/noqqe/vim ~/.vim
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/config/vimrc ~/.vimrc
vim +BundleInstall
```
